# CS210

Summary of project
Project 2 of the CS210 course. In this project I was asked to create code for an investment banking app. The functional requirements include an initial screen to display the initial investment, monthly deposite, annual compounded instrest, number of years of investment and a way to see the data. As the user continues a second screen displays year-end balances and year-end earned interest if no additional monthly deposits are made. From here the user is able to test different monthly deposit amounts, interest rates, and lengths of time to see how increases and decreases impact their investment growth.

What did you do particularly well?
I felt that the efficiency of the code works well. The simplicity in design which meets specifications allows it be maintained in the long term and each step taken in the code is well commented on.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would place the interest calculation functions in a separate file as they could be useful in other apps as well. Additing exception handling constructs could also be useful with a try block to catch any errors or odd user inputs.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was planning the code. Breaking down each step into pseduocode was a great way to tackle these first steps in thinking about how to organize the code. Various tips like system("PAUSE"); for user input were found in W3schools and geeksforgeeks.org.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The basics of loop creation and functions will be in all course work and future projects.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I focused on code efficiency and readability with comments on each step in the process. In a professsional setting this would not only remind myself of the thought processs behind a particular peice of code, if I were to leave or be otherwise unavailable, clearly commented code would demonstrate my thought process.
